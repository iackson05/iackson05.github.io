                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Jackson Smith, I am a Computer Science student at the University of Guelph and this is 
                    my report regarding the first four months of my IT Technician co-op placement at the Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre
                    (which I will refer to as TPASC throughout this report) in the Summer of 2025. TPASC is a sports facility based
                    out of Scarborough, ON and is the home of the Scarborough Shooting Stars of the CEBL and hosts many large events such as
                    the World Aquatics Swimming World Cup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role at TPASC provided me with the chance to put many of the skills that I have learned as a student to use, varying from
                    technical skills like script writing or computer maintnance to soft skills like time management and leadership.

                <h2>About TPASC</h2>
                <h3>Company Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre was built in 2014 to host the Pan Am Games, and has since been used 
                    as a public athletics centre that that sees over 300,000 customers a year. The facility is owned by
                    the City of Toronto and the University of Toronto.
                </p> 
                <h3>About the facility</h3>
                <p>
                    The facility consists of the Field House capable of hosting all of the games for the 
                    Scarborough Shooting Stars, drop-in sports, and other large events such as the orientation for the 
                    students attending UofT Scarborough. There is also an Aquatic Centre that has a training pool, competition 
                    pool, and a dive tank. The competition pool and the dive tank see many large events each year, such as the 
                    World Aquatics Swimming World Cup that will occur in October 2025. Lastly, there is a fitness centre that has
                    countless members visit daily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are roughly 70 Full-Time and 300 Part-Time employees keeping the facility running. I have met 
                    so many great people during my time working at the facility and the staff was very welcoming to the arrival
                    of myself and the other handful of interns that TPASC took on in the summer.
                </p>

            <!-- Goals Section -->
            <section id="goals">
                <h2>Learning Goals & Outcomes</h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of my work term, I established three key learning goals to guide my professional development:
                </p>

                <div class="goal-box">
                    <div class="goal-title">Goal 1: Networking</div>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> I wanted to develop a robust understanding of networking concepts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I approached this goal by getting to know how the networking infrastructure
                    works at the facility (by both physically discovering the components and by familiarizing myself with our 
                    Cisco Meraki portal and our LibreNMS server) and trying to test the knowledge that I gained through a project.</p>
                    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> I still have a ways to go in terms of reaching this goal, but I was able to put my 
                    knowledge to the test by creating a network dashboard for my team on our LibreNMS server. This dashboard consists of
                  a comprehensive network map, device port status updates, server utilizations, and a system log. This project taught me 
                how network components work together (with the network map), how devices are able to connect to our network, how to ping 
              devices for their status using SNMP, and some basic networking concepts (like VLANs, subnets, routing, etc.).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="goal-box">
                    <div class="goal-title">Goal 2: Leadership</div>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> I wanted to better my leadership skills</p>
                    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I approached this goal by trying my best to take initiative and to approach my work with a strong 
                      attitude.</p>
                    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> To me, leadership isn't completely about leading a group people, but also their work ethic and
                    attitude. I made sure that in every task on my plate, I approached everything with a high level of intensity and made sure 
                  that my work was completed to the highest degree. I believe that the best leaders are not just able to lead others,
                  but also themselves. By approaching my work in such a fashion, the skills that I gained will help me when I am in a 
                  position to lead others. I need to be able to lead myself before I can be trusted to lead another individual. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="goal-box">
                    <div class="goal-title">Goal 3: Personal Organization/Time Management</div>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> I wanted to develop stronger time management skills and be a more organized person.</p>
                    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I made sure to layout and detail each of my tasks and create a timeline/checklist to 
                    keep track of my progress and make sure that I was on track to finishing my tasks on time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> I think I developed really strong time organization skills by following this process. 
                    I got all of my work done with ample time to spare, which gave me the opportunity to take on more work than expected
                    by manager. I think this skill will immediately help me become a better student when it comes to managing my time 
                  and workload and I should be a more productive and efficient student because of this experience.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Job Description Section -->
            <section id="job">
                <h2>About the Role</h2>
                
                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    My role at TPASC was titled as IT Technician. The main purpose of my role was to create helpful solutions for 
                    the rest of the staff. I have created multiple solutions/workflows using Microsoft's Power Apps and SharePoint 
                    Online. I am also available for IT support when requested. I gained experience in setting up and maintaining 
                    AV systems. The role is very broad and always keeps me on my toes, but I am very grateful that I am able to 
                    assist the large staff pool of TPASC to hopefully make some lives easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an IT Technician, each day always brings new tasks and problems to solve. My typical day will consist of working 
                    on some project, but other things will come up during the day that require my assistance (i.e. computer help/troubleshooting,
                    being an extra set of hands in another project, etc.). My day at work tends to fly by as I don't feel like I have much downtime.
                     But I love every second of it and love being able to make an impact on others.
                </p>

                <h3>Key Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    The first project I was assigned at TPASC was to create a calendar in SharePoint Online to hold all of the major 
                    events occurring at the facility and meeting room bookings. This project allowed me to showcase some of the programming
                    skills that I have developed as a student to write a script that polls our facility management software, EZFacility,
                    to get event info, and post it to the SharePoint Calendar. I hosted this calendar on AWS to automate the process
                    and make it so that all info on the calendar is up to date.
                    
                    Network Dashboard, Wayfinding Kiosks, Global Calendar, Automated Workflows/digitization of forms
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second project that I worked on is still ongoing and unfinished, but there are plans to have it in place and 
                    up and running before the end of my tenure. It is an automated workflow to handle assignments of onboarding and offboarding 
                    tasks for staff. This project taught me how to utilize Power Automate and create useful automations. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another project that I worked on was to create a network dashboard. This project was assigned to me so that I could 
                    learn the foundation of a network and how it functions. Here I learned things like how my web search requests get routed 
                    and how I am able to access the internet, what pieces are needed to create a network, and how to poll devices to get 
                    their status using SNMP. I discovered the entirety of our network, including the 150+ access points, 15 servers, 2 firewalls
                    and 15+ switches and how all of these technologies can communicate amongst each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some other projects that I have been involved in include setting up wayfinding kiosks for the facility and tracking the IT
                    assets within the facility to create a dashboard in Power BI to easily show replacement forecasts and device statuses, digitizing existing forms
                    using SPFX and JS and using Power Automate to create workflows based on specific criteria in the submission, and I 
                    serviced and tagged over 50 of our assets (desktops, laptops, etc.).
                </p>

                <h3>Interesting Aspects</h3>
                <p>
                    Some of the most interesting aspects of the job include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    • <span class="highlight">Technology and Tools:</span> Including LibreNMS, Cisco Meraki, SPFX, Office 365, VMware/HyperV, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    • <span class="highlight">Team Collaboration:</span> I spent quite some time working among other staff members in other departments
                    such as managing our TVs and the content they play with the Marketing Team, and working with the Administration Team

                <p>
                    I have had an eye-opening semester working at TPASC, it has been really cool working in an office and learning the 
                    business of a sports facility of their amplitude. I have learned so much on the job about the field of Computer 
                    Science and I am excited to continue learning during my second work term here. I think the skills I have 
                    both developed and learned will help me in my career in Computer Science.

                    I think my work term has made me realize the amount of time that I waste when I am in school. In retrospect,
                     the workload during an academic semester is not as bad as I realized and if I spend the same amount of time 
                     on my studies as I do as a co-op student at TPASC, I think I will feel a lot less stressed and have more time to 
                     work on personal projects and enjoy the best years of my life!

                  I am really happy to be fortunate enough to have had a co-op placement during this past semester and I will make an effort
                  to recommend the co-op program to whoever I can!
